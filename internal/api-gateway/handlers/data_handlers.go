package handlers

// This file has been cleaned up as part of the modular refactoring.
// All data handler functionality has been moved to internal/api-gateway/types/data_handler.go
// to improve code organization and maintainability.
//
// The new structure separates:
// - Models: internal/api-gateway/models/
// - Types: internal/api-gateway/types/
// - Handlers: internal/api-gateway/handlers/
//
// This provides better separation of concerns and makes the codebase more maintainable.
